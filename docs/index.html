Having trouble focussing?

Encourage your character to breathe.

Click on the breath dial.

The closer the moving marker is to the smaller markers the
calmer you will become.

The colour that appears indicates how close you were.

The aim of this game is to simulate anxiety,
not cause it.

The game will present you with
accurate information,
just not in the most helpful manner.

.link b5 I understand

Anxiety will steadily build, making it harder to focus.
.action c.causes.push([15,0])

You're going to have to manage both your breath
and the situation you are placed in.

You're about to wake up.

Your right eye opens,
your left is pressed into the cold grating.

"Warning. Proximity Alert. Warning."

The floor tilts and you are rocked painfully onto your side.

This time you feel steadier.
Clearly something terrible is happening.

Once the engines have fuel,
press the red button to reset the day-night cycle.
Press the green button to divert power to food production.

The engineering deck.
It's cramped, even more so that the rest of the ship.

.label fuel
A mess of hoses sprawl across the floor,
littering what had been an orderly fuel recycling lab.
There's little real damage,
and you manage to reconnect most of the piping immediately.
.macro fuelDescribe
There's a guide on the wall, just grab the right pipe from the pile!

ONB7 -> U4: 0.3u

ONB7 -> D2: 0.2u

U4 -> ONB7: 0.2u

A message dominates the readout:
"
.macro detailedEngines
Once the engines are ready to be engaged,
set the oxygen / fuel ratio desired.
Start with 1 part oxygen to 7 parts liquid fuel.
Only once normal running operations have been met should
higher ratios be used,
with a maximum of 5 parts oxygen to 3 parts fuel.
"

.macro enginesBlock

.link eng Location: Engineering

.label ratio

You see a lever indicating how much of the tank should be oxygen
(the rest will be fuel).
How high should you set the lever?

This is a tiny pod just off the cockpit.
All you need to do is get power through the ship,
and the shields should protect you from the rest of the meteorites.
